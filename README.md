dlib.py not opening .. please check once


asap-: resolved

rpi has no cv2 it seems
it is encapsulated in virtual environment 
command -:
source ~/.profile

workon cv 

REVIEW ALIGNMENT CODE 


Add a compiled code with face recognition ..
 fps at 2.7 frame without gpu accelearation.
 
ill update the rest of the code in a few days
###
try installing a few dependencies on raspberry pi :: caffe with cpu loading, scikit-image, tensorflow, keras, open BLAS
###


change the location in the util.py and tensorflow.py 
doownoad the flickr dataset .
extract it 
it is working on my lappy
requires packages like caffe and pandas 
download it 
fives 50 percent accuracy .. good enough ... correct most of the times 





download caffe on raspberry pi 
and for the flickr thing change the directory of flickr into downloads or home and run the command via terminal
it will take 30 mins to create the database 


for the model it takes 10 hours approx 
if you retrain it
